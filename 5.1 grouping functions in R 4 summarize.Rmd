#### Import the data set in the R Environment

```text
Using the read.csv() code we are importing the data set in the R environment. The code stringAsFactors= TRUE is used so that we can convert string variables to factor. 
```
```{R}
data1<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\dataset\\MBA data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

#### using summarise()for Data manipulation

```text
using summarise we will be able to reduces multiple values down to a single summary

using the code
      ?summarise()
we will get the syntex of summarise() in the help tab, which will help us to understand it better.

in summarize we can use following functions:
  -Basic:-	mean(), median(),sum()
  -variation:-		sd(),IQR()
  -Range:-		min(),max(), quantile()
  -Position:-		first(),	last(), nth()	
` -Count:-	n(), n_distinct()	
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```text
Example 1
Find the mean age from the dataset
```

```{r}
summarize(data1, mean(Age_in_years_completed))
```

```text
Example 2
Find the median age from the dataset
```

```{r}
summarize(data1,median(Age_in_years_completed))
```

```text
Example 3
Find the mean and median age from the dataset
```

```{r}
summarize(data1,median(Age_in_years_completed), mean(Age_in_years_completed))

summarize(data1,median=median(Age_in_years_completed), mean=mean(Age_in_years_completed))
```

```text
Example 4
Find the mean, median, sd, iqr, min, max, quantile,and count for age from the dataset
```

```{r}
summarize(data1,
          mean= mean(Age_in_years_completed),
          median= median(Age_in_years_completed),
          standard_deviation=sd(Age_in_years_completed),
          minimum=min(Age_in_years_completed),
          maximum=max(Age_in_years_completed),
          count= n()
          )
```

#### Using group_by() with summarize

```text
Example 5
find mean age for gender seperately using summarize
```

```{r}
# create a group1 using group_by() and then use the group1 as the data set and find mean using summarize() and mean()

group1<-group_by(data1, Gender)
summarise(group1, mean(Age_in_years_completed))
```

```text
Example 6
find mean age, percentage 10, and percentage 12 for gender seperately using summarize
```

```{r}
group1<-group_by(data1, Gender)

summarise(group1, mean_age=mean(Age_in_years_completed),
          mean_per_10=mean(Percentage_in_10_Class),
          mean_per_12=mean(Percentage_in_12_Class)
          )
```

```text
Example 7
find mean age, percentage 10, and percentage 12 for gender and state seperately using summarize
```

```{r}
group2<-group_by(data1,Gender, State)

summarise(group2, mean_age=mean(Age_in_years_completed),
          mean_per_10=mean(Percentage_in_10_Class),
          mean_per_12=mean(Percentage_in_12_Class)
          )
```
