By using control structures we can direct how a group of R expressions are executed. In essence, control structures let you add "logic" to your R code as opposed to just repeatedly running the same R code. You can execute various R expressions based on inputs or data attributes by using control structures to react to them.

  In this section we will be studying few control structures such as
    - if and else: testing a condition and acting on it
    - for: execute a loop a fixed number of times
    - while: execute a loop while a condition is true
    - repeat: execute an infinite loop (must break out of it to stop)
    - break: break the execution of a loop

```

#### Using if control function

```text

The syntex for the if is as below

if(<condition>) {
      do something
}

      Continue with rest of code

The above code does nothing if the condition is false. If you have an action you want to execute when the condition is false, then you need an else clause.
and then it will be if else control


Creating a simple if control 

```

```{r}
a <- 10
b <- 20

if (b > a) {
  print("b is greater than a")
} 

```

```text
create a if else () control function which is extention of the previous function
```

```{r}
a <- 20
b <- 10

if (b > a) {
  print("b is greater than a")
} else

{
  print("a is greater than b")
}

```

```text
we can further extend this if else to, else if, where we will be able to add more conditions

````

```{r}
percentage1<-70

if (percentage1 < 50) {
  print("Fail")
} else if(percentage1 <60){
  print("Pass with second Division")
} else
  {
  print("Pass with First Division")
}
```

```text
The same example can be extended using more else if statement
```

```{r}
percentage1<-50

if (percentage1 <=50) {
  print("Fail")
} else if(percentage1 <=60){
  print("Pass with second Division")
} else if (percentage1<=75)
{
  print("Pass with first Division")
}else
  {
  print("Pass with First Division and distinction")
  }
```

```text
if else loop can also be applied to r object such as list, vector, etc
```

```{r}
x<-c(1:10)
print(x)
if(x[1] =="1") {
  print(x[1])
} else {
    print("not one")
  }
```

```{r}
if(x[1] =="2") {
  print(x[1])
} else {
    print("not one")
  }

```

```text
Example 
```

```{r}
x<-c(1:10)
if(x[1]== 1) { print(x[1])
              } else if (x[1] ==2){
                print("not 1 but 2")
                } else {
    print("not 1 or 2")
      }
```

#### control loop for

```text
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence for example it will iterate a expression till a specific condition is meet

The syntex for the for loop is as below:

  for(variable in sequence) 
  { 
  statements
  }
```

```text
Create a sequence of numbers starting from 1 to 10
```

```{r}
for (i in 1:10)
{
  print(i)
}
```

```text
Find sum of n natural number using for loop
```

```{r}
sum1<-0
for(i in 1:10)
    {
   sum1=sum1+i
   print(sum1)
    }
```

```text
for loop can also be used with vector, list or r objects
```

```{r}
x<-c(1:10)
for(i in 1:10)
{
print(x[i])
}
```

```{r}
x<-c(20:30)
for (i in  x[i]) {
  print(x[5])  
}
```

```text
For loop can also be used for string vectors
```

```{r}
x<-c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")
for (i in  x[i]) {
  print(x[4])  
}
```

#### creating a nested loop 

```{r}
mat1<-matrix(c(11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
for (i in 1:3)
  { 
  for (j in 1:3)
    {
    print(mat1[i,j])
    }
}
```

```text
More than one control loop can be joined together.
For and if else control can be used together
```

```{r}
x<-c(1:10)
for(i in 1:10)
{
if(x[i] == 1) {
  print(x[i])
} else {
  print("not one")
}
}
```

##### control loop While

```text
While loops begin by testing a condition, If that condition is true, then it execute the loop body. Once the loop body is executed, the condition is tested again, and so on, till the condition is false, after which the loop exits.

The syntex for while loop is as below: 

while (test_expression)
{
statement
}

or 

while (condition) exp
```

```{r}
x<-1
while (x<10) {
  print(x)
  x=x+1
  }
```

```text
while control can be used with vector, list and r Object
```

```{r}
Alfabet1<-c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")
x<-1
while (x<4) {
  print(Alfabet1[x])
  x=x+1
  }
```

```text
Calculate the sum of the first ten natural numbers using while loop
```
```{r}
n = 1
sum = 0
while(n <= 10) {
  sum = sum + n
  n = n + 1
    }
print(sum)
```

##### Control loop Break

```text
Break loop is also widely used; 

The syntax of break statement is:

 if (test_expression) {
                        break
                      }
```

```{r}
x<-c(1:10)
for(i in 1:10)
{
print(x[i])
if (x[i]==5)
  break()
}
```
