#### Data Transformation and Manipulating

```text
Today's businesses are changing because of data. Everything depends on data, including daily operations and business decisions. And none of this is feasible without first converting raw data into useful information that is usable, especially when there is a lot of data and information coming from many sources.

Data manipulation refers to the process of adjusting data to make it organised and easier to read. Using the Package "dplyr" we can adjusts data by inserting, deleting and modifying data and variables in a database such as to be used in a required way.

The basic operations which we will be studying are 

  mutate() 
  Which adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
  
  select() 
  picks variables based on their names
  
  filter() 
  picks cases based on their values
  
  summarise() 
  reduces multiple values down to a single summary
  
  arrange() 
  changes the ordering of the rows
```
#### using mutate()for Data manipulation
```text
Before staring with basic operations on the data using dplyr package we will import a data set. forthe same we will be using a data set MBAdata. The data set consists of 18 variables and 273 cases. The variables of the daat set are 
SNO, Age in years completed,	Percentage in 10 Class,	Percentage in 12 Class,	Percentage in Under Graduate,	Gender,	State,	Previous Degree,	Fathers qualification,	Mothers qualification,	Fathers occupation,	Mothers occupation,	Marital status,	Place you belong to,	Total Family Income per annum,	Funding for the MBA Program,	Work Experience,	and Career options after MBA.
```
#### Import the data set in the R Environment

```text
Using the read.csv() code we are importing the data set in the R environment. The code stringAsFactors= TRUE is used so that we can convert string variables to factor. 
```
```{R}
data1<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\dataset\\MBA data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

#### Understanding the data set

```text
In order to understand the data set we will be using str(), dim(), view() and summary(). These codes will help to understand the data set in a better way.
```

```{r}
str(data1)
dim(data1)
```

```text
From str() it is cleer that the data set has 5 scale variables which include SNO, Age, percenatge in 10; 12; and UG. and 13 categorical variables. 
```

```{r}
summary(data1)
```

```text
From summary(data1), we will be able to get basic descriptive statistic, which will help us to understand the data at the initial level. 
```
#### manupulaing the data using dplyr 
#### mutate()

```text
using mutate() we will create new new variables that are functions of existing variables
using the code
      ?mutate()
we will get the syntex of mutate() in the help tab, which will help us to understand it better.

Example 1:
I want to add a constant value 100 to the variable percentage 10 and store it in the same dataset.
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
data1<-mutate(data1, Percentage_in_10_Class=Percentage_in_10_Class+100)
str(data1)

```

```text
Example 2:
I want to add a constant value 100 to the variable percentage 10 and store it in a as a new variable (percentage_10_2 ) in the same data set
```

```{r}
data1<-mutate(data1, Percentage_in_10_Class2=Percentage_in_10_Class+100)
str(data1)

```

```text
Example 3
If required we can store it as a different dataset say (data2).
```

```{r}
data2<-mutate(data1, Percentage_in_10_Class2=Percentage_in_10_Class+100)
str(data2)
```

```text
Example 4
we can create more than one variable at the same time, for example i want to create two variables X and Y, where X is two times of age and Y is four times of age
```

```{r}
data1<-mutate(data1,X= Age_in_years_completed*2,Y= Age_in_years_completed*4 )
str(data1)
```

```text

we can create a variable using more than one variable form the data set itself.

Example 5
we want to create a variable which is average percentage of 10, 12 and UG percentage of the students
```

```{r}
data1<-mutate(data1,average=(Percentage_in_10_Class+ Percentage_in_12_Class + Percentage_in_Under_Graduate)/3 )
str(data1)
```


```text
we can create a variable using more than one variable from the data set itself.

Example 6
we want to convert age into standard age using Z=(x-mean)/sd
```

```{r}
data1<-mutate(data1, percentageageZ= (Age_in_years_completed-mean(Age_in_years_completed))/sd(Age_in_years_completed))

str(data1)
```
