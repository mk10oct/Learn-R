#### Basic Vector operations

```text
we can use R as Calculator, where we can perform simple operations on numbers directly or by creating r object or vector. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
```
```{r}
2+3
2-3
2*3
2/3
2+9+8+8
5-9+7*8
```

```text 
similary square, square-root, power, exponential and so on can also be calculated directly
```

```{r}
sqrt(25)
5^2
exp(2)
log(2,10)
log(2, exp(1))
log10(2)
```

```text
Instead of numbers we can store the values in the form of r object as variable and then can use them also
```
```{r}
x<-5
y<-10

x1<-c(1,2,3,4,5)
y1<-c(10,25,36,47,51)
x+y
x*y
x-y
x/y
x^y
exp(x)
exp(-y)
log(x)
log10(y)

x1+y1
x1*y1
x1-y1
x1/y1
x1^y1
exp(x1)
exp(-y1)
log(x1)
log10(y1)
```
