#### Import data set in R Environment

```text
In this section we will be using a very small part of the Big Mart dataset to learn how to view the dataset imported in R environment. The dataset location is 

          C:/Users/User/Documents/dataset/Big Mart Dataset Small.csv
Since the dataset which is entered in the data set has many string variables they are convereted to character. In order to convert them into factor, we can use stringsAsFactors = TRUE. 

The first thing which we can use is str(), to understand the structure of the R object. 
```

```{r}
data1<-read.csv("C:/Users/User/Documents/dataset/Big Mart Dataset Small.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
str(data1)
```

```text
To Know the dimensions of an object, dim(object)is used 
```

```{r}
dim(data1)
```

```text
class of an object (numeric, matrix, data frame, etc)can be identified using class(), we can also use typeof()
```
```{r}
class(data1)

typeof(data1)
```

```text
IN order to understand the R object in a better way we can also use names() to know the names of the variables in the data set.
```
```{r}
names(data1)
```


```text
In order to check the whole r object, in this case the data set. we will use print() or we can directly use the R object data1 it self. we can also use fix() to check the R object created just like a excel sheet, which can be edited also.
```

```{r}
data1

print(data1)

fix(data1)
```

```{r, fig.align='right', echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path="D:/R online Course SIU/R codes/fix1.png")
```

```text
Further more we will use nrow() to find the number of rows in the data set and ncol() to find the number for columns in the data set. 

```
```{r}
nrow(data1)
ncol(data1)
```

```text
In the similar way we will use length(), head() and tail() for viewing the data set. 

```
```{r}
length(data1) 
```

```text
Gives the number of variables in the R object
```

```{r}
length(data1$Item_Identifier) 
```

```text
gives the length of the variable item_identifier in of the dataset data1
```

```text
Using head() and tail() to view the top 6 rows of the data set with all the variables,similary tail is also used for bottom 6 rows of teh data set with all teh variables 
```

```{r}
head(data1)
head(data1, n=4)
head(data1, 4)
head(data1, 10)


tail(data1)
tail(data1, 4)
tail(data1, 10)

```

```text
Use fo [] for viewing dataset is one of the best option, data1[rows,columns]
```

```{r}
data1[]
data1[,]
```
# whole dataset
```{r}
data1[1,]
```

```text
only first row with all the variables
```
```{r}
data1[1:5,]
```

```text
first to fifth row with all the variables
```
```{r}
data1[1:5,1]
```

```text
first to fifth row with only first variable
```

```{r}
data1[1:5,c(1,5)]
```

```text
first to fifth row with first and fifth variable
```

```{r}
data1[1:5,c(1:5)]
```

```text
first to fifth row with first to fifth variable
```


```{r}
data1[2,5]
```

```text
it gives 2nd row and 5th column values; its gives the value of 5th variable for 2nd respondent
```

```{r}
data1[2,5]
```

```text
Similary we can use [] for variables of the dataset also
```
```{r}
data1$Item_Weight
data1$Item_Weight[]
```
